the reason for this
that by grouping the u and v values together , the image becomes much more compressible . when given an array of an image in the y ' uv420p format , all the y ' values come first , followed by all the u values , followed finally by all the v values . as with most y ' uv formats , there are as many y ' values as there are pixels . where x equals the height multiplied by the width , the first x indices in the array are y ' values that correspond to each individual pixel

to add dimension children for complex type dimension as internally we are creating dimension column for each each complex dimension so when complex query dimension request will come in the query , we need to add its children as it is hidden from the user for example if complex dimension is of array of string [ 2 ] so we are storing 3 dimension and when user will query for complex type i . e . array type we need to add its children and then we will read respective block and create a tuple based on all three dimension
to add its children as it is hidden from the user for example

as arraylists can hold null elements
the number of elements that need to be flushed starting from index 0
that an arraylist has been passed in , which may or may not have a size bigger that the actual number of elements that are meant to be flushed to the circular buffer . thus the ' uptoindex ' parameter specifies the number of elements that need to be flushed starting from index 0 . note that after flushing , the circular buffer may return a memory unit ( of type t ) for reuse in the list , if the circular buffer popped off memory to preserve its circular nature . or it may just return null if nothing was popped off . either way , the list that is returned by this method , is of the same size as the list passed in , as arraylists can hold null elements . the only difference is that the list returned will have elements that reference old popped - off memory from the circular - buffer or null
