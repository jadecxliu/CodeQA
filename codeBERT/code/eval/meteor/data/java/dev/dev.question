( 2 ) rotating the order of the arguments does not affect the result . ( 3 ) exchanging any two arguments inverts the result . this function is essentially like taking the sign of the determinant of a , b , c , except that it has additional logic to make sure that the above properties hold even when the three points are coplanar , and to deal with the limitations of floating - point arithmetic . note : a , b and c are expected to be of unit length . otherwise , the ?

What do it request since this method can safely assume that no events have been missed if it finds no gaps in the event sequence by queueing the execution of a lookuptask event may have been missed ?
What does the code called by the lookuplistener ' s notify ( ) method recall ?
What states that if the sequence numbers of two successive events differ by only 1 , then one can be assured that no events were missed . on the other hand , if the difference is greater than 1 ( the sequence contains a " gap " ) , then one or more events may - - or may not - - have been missed . thus , if a gap is found in the events , although it ' s possible that no events were missed , this method takes the conservative approach by assuming events were missed . when this method determines that an event may have been missed , it requests a current " snapshot " of the given serviceregistrar ' s state by queueing the execution of a lookuptask . since this method can safely assume that no events have been missed if it finds no gaps in the event sequence , this method queues the notification of the entity by requesting the execution of a notifyeventtask . note that when a lookup service is discovered , this utility registers with that lookup service ' s event mechanism for service events related to the services of interest . upon registering with the event mechanism , a data structure ( of type eventreg ) containing information about that registration is placed in a map for later processing when events do arrive . if the timing is right , it is possible that a service event may arrive between the time the registration is made and the time the eventreg is stored in the map . thus , this method may find that the eventregmap does not contain an element corresponding to the event this method is currently processing . in that case , this method will do nothing . it will simply return so that the service referenced in the event can be discovered using the snapshot returned by the lookuptask that is ultimately queued by the registerlistenertask ( whose listener registration caused this method to be invoked in the first place ) ?
